<b>Introduction</b> <br>
In this project, we are using data from Kaggle to train machine learning model in supervised learning, unsupervised learning and State-of-the-Art Model approach to compare the performance of different approaches. Please see the Jupytor notebook to view the procedure from data exploration, data preprocessing to training, evaluating and testing the models for the face mask detection.
